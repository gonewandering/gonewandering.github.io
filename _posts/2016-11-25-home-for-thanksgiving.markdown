Living in New York is particularly refreshing. The city is built around highs and lows, and living there, constantly beating the tough moments or stumbling into new ones, has been one of the most rewarding things I've done.

But, once in a while, being back on my parent's couch or running around the back yard with the dogs, feels better than anything else. This Thanksgiving was one of those times.

The road into the Eel River Valley is nearly always shrouded in Fog; blackened with a thin layer of dew. At night, its dark surface glitters with reflections from tall grasses that crowd its edges and the eyes of cows, deer, and occasional foxes and coyotes that line up at the edge of your headlights.

Driving into the valley at night is a haunting experience, possibly attributable to bleery hours on the road, but more likely, a combination of the surreality of the area's aloofness and the feeling that you're standing just at the edge of a place without going in—like seeing a Christmas party from outside a frosty window.

Luckily, the moments of arrival are fairly short, it's around five miles from the bridge that marks the entrance to the valley, to my parents' farm house on the far end.
