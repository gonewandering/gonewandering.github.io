I've started getting back into 3D modelling with Cinema4D for fun. I really enjoy the lack of limitations and the ability to explore concepts with a 3D program. Playing with my initials seemed like a cool thing to do first. Here're a couple renderings.

Virtual camera at 1/4s shutter speed (too slow).

Faster camera but weird angle. Looks like a cheap gameshow...

Slowed down the camera speed a bit to get good motion-blur. Looks better.

Changed the camera angle and started to play with some of the colors.

And the final product. I really like how this came out.
