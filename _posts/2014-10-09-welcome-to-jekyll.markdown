Thanks for visiting Gone Wandering. This is my personal blog, and will hold a combination of tech, travel, and design posts that I've done, and will do in the coming months (and years). 

I've owned gonewandering.com since 2004, and during that time, it's held over a dozen iterations on this site. Each lasts (usually through a specific adventure) and then comes down. This time I'll try to round up my posts from throughout time and maintain an ongoing index of my misadventures.

Hope you enjoy, and let me know if you have thoughts or ideas. I'm always open to those.

Lindsay
