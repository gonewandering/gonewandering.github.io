At Eight PM, after having missed my flight from London to Nairobi, I went searching for a hotel in London Heathrow. Lucky for me, Heathrow is a big place (see below), and they have several choices in the ‘in-terminal’ hotel area. I ended up staying at an amazing place called Yotel, a local concept that takes the eastern sleep cube, and adapts it for tall snobby westerners. Although each room is only 10’x10’ they have all of the amenities of a much larger hotel; comfortable bed, internet, shower, and room service. On top of this was the fact that the rooms were lit by your choice of black light, blue light or ‘full-sun’.

After spending a restful day in the Yotel, I boarded my flight to Nairobi at 8PM the next night. The 24 hours after that are a blur and I won’t go into details, except to say that I made it to Kigali with all of my bags.

For my first and second nights, I’m staying in the house of the chief of operations for UNICEF. He’s French, his family lives in Nairobi, and he has absolutely no furniture. He also goes to bed at 8PM and gets up between 2 or 3AM to roam around the house doing who-knows-what. The electricity in the house is spotty and it’s a little creepy, but I’m moving to another house on Wednesday so all should be well. </p>
