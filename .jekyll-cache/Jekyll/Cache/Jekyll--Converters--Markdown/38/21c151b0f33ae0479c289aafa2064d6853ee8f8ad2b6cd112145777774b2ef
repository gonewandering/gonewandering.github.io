I"&<p>Ingredients:</p>

<p>8 oz elbow macaroni
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1-2 onions, chopped
1-2 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp thyme
1-2 green peppers, chopped
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup shredded parmesan cheese
1 large can diced tomatoes (28 oz), or more</p>

<p>Break up the ground beef into a Dutch oven or large frying pan sprayed with olive oil and begin browning over medium-high heat, adding the minced garlic and chopped onions, oregano, and thyme. When all the meat is just about brown and the onions transparent, stir in the chopped green pepper and the can of tomatoes.  This panload should smell really good. Continue cooking until the green pepper is just limp, still bright green.</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 350º.</p>

<p>Boil a pot of water, adding 1/2 teaspoon salt, for the macaroni, and cook according to package directions. When it is al dente, pour it into a colander in the sink and drain.</p>

<p>Mix the meat mixture with the macaroni and add the parmesan cheese.</p>

<p>Spray an 11” x 13” pan with olive oil and pour everything into it. If you want, you can sprinkle more parmesan cheese on top. Bake for 25-30 minutes until bubbly; be careful not to overcook as it will dry out.</p>

<p>Remove from oven and let sit a few minutes before serving up with a nice Chianti and a big green salad.</p>
