I"ë<p>First of all, I did not come up with this workout. I got all of my information from a NY Times article (link), that in turn got the idea from the American Journal of Sports Medicine. The real kudos go to them.</p>

<p>I did however, really want to try it, and had no good way to time myself. So, a couple weeks ago (on a Wednesday night), I built a way, and on Thursday morning (at 11:47AM) I shared it on Hacker News.</p>

<p>Within hours of posting the app, the numbers on Google Analytics had skyrocketed. At itâ€™s peak that first day, the app had 600 users every 30 seconds. The day ended with 25,000 pageviews. I hadnâ€™t thought to even add share buttons when I launched, but after adding a like button I received over 1,100 likes the first day.</p>

<p>At the same time, I started receiving emails from developers who were interested in porting the web version to iPhone, Android, and even Windows Phone apps. The reception in the community was incredible. A week after the website launched, I received an email from a Canadian developer who really wanted to take 7-Min to the next level. He offered to buy the site, and more importantly to push it forward. I have a full-time job, a ton of other interests, and this was a great opportunity to see my work go further. Within a few days, weâ€™d agreed on a price, and I turned the keys over to him.</p>

<p>This experience was great. I followed a lot of the product development rules Iâ€™ve learned in much larger projects, and learned a ton about a full product-cycle in three weeks.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m now completely removed from 7-min.com but itâ€™s one of the most enjoyable things Iâ€™ve done recently.</p>

<p>The numbers for the first week</p>
