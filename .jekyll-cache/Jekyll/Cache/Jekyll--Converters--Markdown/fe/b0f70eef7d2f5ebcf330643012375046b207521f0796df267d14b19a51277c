I"ù<p>I have a good friend who is doing his first startup. He is ambitious, young, and willing to do anything for his idea. Heâ€™s taking huge risks. He has no savings, has lived for a year on credit cards and top ramen, and is going to keep going until he makes this work, or dies. He doesnâ€™t understand risk.</p>

<p>I have other friends who are in steady jobs at great companies, and are considering startups. Their first question is always, â€œHow much personal runway do I need if this thing fails?â€. They donâ€™t understand risk either.</p>

<p>There seem to be two approaches to understanding personal risk. The top-down approach, requires that you understand the worst case scenerio, the best case scenerio, and your likelihood of falling on either. The bottom-up approach means that you understand what you absolutely arenâ€™t willing to risk and then never do things that have any probability of crossing that thresholdâ€”your life as an MVP.</p>

<p>I like the bottom-up approach.</p>

<p>For me, having a comfortable bed, the ability to eat out a few times a week and to travel fairly often, are things Iâ€™m not willing to give up. At a minimum, this means that I need about $3,000/month after taxes. I usually find myself with more, but I can get by on that in a pinch.</p>

<p>With this knowledge, I know that if I take a risk that will mean I donâ€™t get paid for six months, I better have at least $20,000 in the bank, or a plan to get it. Conversly, if I find myself getting low on savings, or not generating at least $3,000 in revenue, it means Iâ€™d probably better change course.</p>

<p>Everyone is different, and there are obviously other parts to this equation, but approaching my life as a minimum viable product helps me stay sane and (somewhat) stable.</p>
