I"j<p>Thanks for visiting Gone Wandering. This is my personal blog, and will hold a combination of tech, travel, and design posts that I’ve done, and will do in the coming months (and years).</p>

<p>I’ve owned gonewandering.com since 2004, and during that time, it’s held over a dozen iterations on this site. Each lasts (usually through a specific adventure) and then comes down. This time I’ll try to round up my posts from throughout time and maintain an ongoing index of my misadventures.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy, and let me know if you have thoughts or ideas. I’m always open to those.</p>

<p>Lindsay</p>
