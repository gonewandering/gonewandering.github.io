I"ã<p>Iâ€™ve started getting back into 3D modelling with Cinema4D for fun. I really enjoy the lack of limitations and the ability to explore concepts with a 3D program. Playing with my initials seemed like a cool thing to do first. Hereâ€™re a couple renderings.</p>

Virtual camera at 1/4s shutter speed (too slow).</p>

Faster camera but weird angle. Looks like a cheap gameshowâ€¦</p>

Slowed down the camera speed a bit to get good motion-blur. Looks better.</p>

Changed the camera angle and started to play with some of the colors.</p>

And the final product. I really like how this came out.</p>
