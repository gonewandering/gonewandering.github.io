I"i<p>Makes 4 pints</p>

<p>In each of hot sterile pints jar put:</p>

<p>¼ tsp cayenne pepper
1 peeled clove garlic
1 head dill or 1-1/2 Tbsp combined dill weed and dill seed</p>

<p>Pack lengthwise in the jars, leaving ¼” headroom:</p>

<p>2lb. stemmed tender green beans</p>

<p>Bring to a boil:</p>

<p>2-1/2 C water
2-1/2 C vinegar
¼ C salt</p>

<p>Pour the mixture over the beans, leaving ¼ “ headroom and tamping the jar lightly to release bubbles. Seal the jars and process 15 minutes in a boiling water bath (I use a steam-canner).  Remove from the bath with tongs and let cool until the seals pop.</p>
