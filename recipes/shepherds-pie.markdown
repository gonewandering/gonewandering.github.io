Pardon the lapse In response to your query concerning the ancient family recipe for Shepherd’s Pie. I had to contact my Druid Masters to see if it is time to reveal to the next generation the secret source of the Silver Family power and uncanny luck. Unfortunately the WiFi at Stonehenge is spotty so sometimes it takes a while to get a reply.

Normally the passing on of the recipe involves the initiate being staked down on a pentagram drawn in the mud of a pig sty, ravens claws, a goats head, mouse droppings, a candle made of toad fat, a hummingbird spleen and a number of other unpleasant things that we’ll get to in the ingredients section. However the Druid Council understands these are extraordinary times and are willing to streamline the process as they did during the Black Plague, the Great Influenza Pandemic and the creation of Twitter.

Here, then, is that which many men have sought but few have attained and fewer still could control the power and the wind contained in this majestic dish.

Ingredients:

- Haunch of a buck South African Wheezing Gazelle suffering from dropsy (if this in not available you can use ½ lb lean ground beef or bison burger plus one lb of Italian sausage).
- 3 tablespoons of Himalayan snake orchid seed oil or olive oil, whichever is more abundant at your native market.
- Ground Kudsu or 1-2 tsp cumin
- Goitered thyroid gland of a greater Kudu or 1 onion, chopped
- Juice from an Amazon Death Pickle (not too much!) or juice from 1 ½ lemons
- A branch of Indian Bitterbush watered only with tiger whiz or 1 rosemary cutting
- The rendered fat of a thousand tarartula wasps or 1-2 cans of Cambell’s Cream of Mushroom soup
- 3 Jack Rabbit turds or 2 cloves of garlic
- Camel dung that has been rolled at least a cubit by a virgin dung beetle or 3-4 lbs of potatoes, chopped.           
- The flowers from a carrion plant grown in tapir poo or 1 – 1 ½ cups chopped broccoli
- Owl pellets from a dyspeptic Himalayan Swamp Owl or 1 cup fresh or canned string beans
- Tips cut from 5 starfish legs or ½ cup of canned or fresh corn
- Earwax globs from 20 Slovenian peasant children or ½-1 cup fresh or frozen peas
- A handful of whale lice or ½ cup chopped carrots
- Musk gland contents from a sexually ambiguous wolverine or 1-1 ½ cups grated cheddar cheese (Note: Musk gland from a wolverine that is secure in its sexual identity is too strong!)
- Refrigerator leftovers- in the beginning this ingredient was actually whatever the royal cook could scrape from the dungeon floor after the prisoners had died or were dragged off for beheading. Over time, as this recipe found its way into the hands of commoners who did not possess dungeons, the scrapings from the outhouse floor then the back of the ice box were substituted.

For cooking, an engine fire, funeral pyre, nuclear reactor fire, magma extrusion and smelting oven have all been used at one time or another with general success. Preheat to 350 degrees.

Once the ingredients have been “mise en place” ‘ed, you will need a large cauldron. Witch supply stores usually have a good selection but if you are of noble rural peasant stock, the oil pan from a Ford short block engine or half a seasoned oil drum will do. First, put the camel dung in a steamer with hot ditch water to get soft; about 20 min.  Heat the oil in the pan (caution: hot Himalayan snake orchid seed oil occasionally will cause dark matter to become visible. Do not become alarmed if the room suddenly looks like it is full of Dayglo cotton candy) and sautee the chopped thyroid and jackrabbit turds a few minutes then add the Kudsu, gazelle and bitterbush. Cook over medium fire until the gazelle is mostly brown. Next, add the rendered wasp fat then place the death pickle juice in the cans the wasp fat was in (I’m assuming you are using canned wasp fat as to render the wasp fat yourself would be, like, crazy hard) and swish it around getting the rest of the fat out of the can and add it to the pot. Add the rest of the ingredients except the wolverine musk and simmer until the new ingredients are mildly softened or the paint starts peeling in the kitchen (15-20 min). Meanwhile make a mash out of the soft camel dung. I like to whip mine with otter urine and giraffe butter but records show us that mastodon milk and maggot puree were the first mash ingredients. If by some chance you are using potatoes, milk and butter from the cow also work.

Once the gazelle mixture has simmered and the mash is ready, remove the bitterbush and pour the thick gazelle mix in something equivalent to a 9 X14” baking dish then spread the mash evenly over the whole surface. Last, spread the wolverine musk evenly over the mash. (Interesting historical side note: King Whilhem the Ghastly had his cooks layer the pie in the helmets of dead French army officers. He swore the seasoned hatbands gave the pie a sublime, sophisticated flavor that fairly waltzed on the palette) Place in hot oven for 30 min until the musk is browned and all the house plants are dead.

Well that’s it my sons. I have bestowed a terrible power and great responsibility on you. Use it wisely. You are responsible for passing on this sacred jewel of our lineage to our children yet unborn. Keep it safe from those unworthy and for god’s sake don’t franchise it!
