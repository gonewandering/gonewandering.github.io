Cook 3 chicken breasts by whatever means. If you boil them, add carrots, onion, celery, peppercorns, and bay leaf and then you will have a nice chicken stock to use later.

Cut the chicken breasts into big hunks.

Steam 1 pound broccoli till just tender.

Combine in a bowl:

1 can cream of chicken soup
2/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 milk, cream, or evaporated milk
1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp curry powder

Preheat oven to 350ยบ.

Oil a 2 quart casserole. Break up the broccoli into large hunks and arrangethe broccoli on the bottom of the casserole. Arrange the chicken hunks on top of that. Pour the sauce mixture over them. If desired, top with a mixture of 1 Tbsp melted butter and 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs.

Bake the whole shebang 3o minutes.

Let sit 5 minutes after removing from oven, then serve.
