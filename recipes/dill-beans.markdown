Makes 4 pints

In each of hot sterile pints jar put
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
1 peeled clove garlic
1 head dill or 1-1/2 Tbsp combined dill weed and dill seed

Pack lengthwise in the jars, leaving ¼” headroom:
2lb. stemmed tender green beans

Bring to a boil:
2-1/2 C water
2-1/2 C vinegar
¼ C salt

Pour the mixture over the beans, leaving ¼ “ headroom and tamping the jar lightly to release bubbles. Seal the jars and process 15 minutes in a boiling water bath (I use a steam-canner).  Remove from the bath with tongs and let cool until the seals pop.
