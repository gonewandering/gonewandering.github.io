8 oz elbow macaroni
1/2 tsp salt
3 Tbsp butter
1 onion, chopped
3-4 Tbsp flour
1-1/2 cups milk
1 bay leaf
1/4 tsp thyme
1-2 cups grated mild or medium cheddar cheese (do not use sharp)
1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
1/2 cup bread crumbs

Melt butter in saucepan, add onion. Cook on medium heat until onion is transparent. Stir in flour and keep stirring for a few minutes, until everything is golden. Maybe it will be a bit dry but that’s OK, stir constantly so it doesn’t burn.

Turn the heat to low. Pour in milk a bit at a time while stirring with a whisk, until you have a nice smooth creamy sauce. Lower the heat to simmer, add the bay leaf, thyme, and some pepper if desired, and let simmer for a few minutes while you cook the macaroni. Stir occasionally. The sauce should be creamy but still liquid; if it is too thick, add more milk.

Cook macaroni in salted water according to package directions, until al dente. Drain in the sink in a colander. Preheat the oven to 350º.  Toss the two kinds of cheese together in a bowl.

While macaroni is draining, add the cheese bit by bit to the sauce, stirring gently all the while. This should thicken up the sauce a bit; if necessary add more milk to keep it creamy. DO NOT LET IT BOIL after you have added the cheese; if you do, it will curdle. If it’s curdled, it will still taste good but it won’t look as good.

Mix the drained macaroni with the sauce and pour into a buttered oven-proof 8” x 8” serving dish. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top. For extra richness, toss the breadcrumbs with a tablespoon of melted butter before putting them on the macaroni—they brown nicely this way.

 Bake 25 minutes until bubbly. Remove from oven and let sit five minutes before serving. This is exceptionally great with a good green salad with vinaigrette dressing, and brownies for dessert!
